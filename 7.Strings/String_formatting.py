name = 'Rishi'
place = 'Blr'
time = '8 pm'

print('hello ' + name + ' please come to ' + place + ' at ' + time)

#instead of using the above, we do do the following

#String Formatting or Interpolation

print('Hello %s please come to %s at %s ' %(name,place,time))

# %s is called conversion specifiers
# easier to read!!

# we can make our code a lot more readable
