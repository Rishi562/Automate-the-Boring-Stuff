# This program says hello and asks for my name

print ('hello World')   #called calling the print functiom
print ('Whats your name') #calling a print function, it is passing an argument"what is your name"


myname = input ()

print ('good to meet you' + myname)
print ('the lenght of your name is :')
print(len(myname))
print('whats your age ? :')
myage = input ()

print ('you will be ' + str(int(myage)+ 1) + ' in a year')

#str and int and float functions are handly if we have to convert between datatypes
#input function always returns a string value !!!
#so we convert the my age into int to add 1 to it
#then we convert it to string so we can concat and print it!!!
